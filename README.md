I study machine learning for predicting structural materials, especially concrete and flyashes. This repository is about this code.

The first one is Fly ashes.
=================
This study develops into a three-step model.
* The first model is about "Prediction of Flyashes of Total Amorphous Content(wt. %)". 
* The second model is about "Prediction of **_Domestic_** Flyashes of Total Amorphous Content(wt. %)". 
* The third model is about "Prediction of Domestic Flyashes of RAl2O3, RSiO2 Content(wt. %)."

The second one is Concrete.
