<h2 align="center">Prediction of Structural Materials Using Machine Learning</h2>

**- `Material characteristics` in cases where it cannot be predicted by existing theories or where economic feasibility and field applicability are poor with existing experimental equipment were predicted using machine learning.**

**- `Domian` is the following 3 materials.**


**1. Compressive Strength of `Concrete`**

**2. Reactivity of `Flyash(FA)`, an eco-friendly alternative material to concrete**
